# Transcribed Sanity Valve

We aim to accurately transcribe the entirety of the [Sanity Valve
discography][bc].

Content warnings for:
- near-constant 'ironic' homophobia and misogyny
- crude sexual content, including near-constant references to the performer's genitals
- 'ironic' racial insensitivity, including caricature of Black identity
- discussions of unprovoked deadly violence, including depiction of the murder of sex workers
- arguably transphobia
- several references to child abuse
- graphic descriptions of bowel movements

To the small group of people who are [Very Scary Scenario][vss], these are
culturally important songs. We are aware that in many ways, they are directly
harmful to real people, ourselves included. Our primary goal is that we want to
ensure that they can be searched for.

Annotating this stuff to explain what's going on is a whole secondary project,
one that GitHub may or may not turn out to be appropriate for. We shall see.
For now, we are just aiming to transcribe what is said in the text of these
songs.
