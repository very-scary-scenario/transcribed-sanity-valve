# Transcribed Sanity Valve

We aim to accurately transcribe the entirety of the [Sanity Valve
discography][bc].

Content warnings for:
- near-constant 'ironic' homophobia and misogyny
- crude sexual content, including near-constant references to the performer's genitals
- 'ironic' racial insensitivity, including caricature of Black identity
- discussions of unprovoked deadly violence, including depiction of the murder of sex workers
- references to child sexual abuse
- references to animal cruelty
- graphic descriptions of bowel movements

To the small group of people who are [Very Scary Scenario][vss], these are
culturally important songs. We are aware that in many ways, they are directly
harmful to real people, ourselves included. Our primary goal is that we want to
ensure that they can be searched for.
