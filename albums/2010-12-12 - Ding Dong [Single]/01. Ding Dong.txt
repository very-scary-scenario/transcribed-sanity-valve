Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
Ding dong merrily on high
<Isn't it ??>

G:: The room is cold, the lighting's low
The mood is festive, up to my eyes in snow
Commercialism killed the message of Christ and so
I get nice socks, so I quite like it though

I don't get cold 'cause my windows is well glazed
I like Christmas 'cause Christmas has got twelve days
I don't like eggnog 'cause it's name is racist
People celebrate Christmas in famous places

Like Chigwell, it's, well, Christmas is great
I get presents then shoot haters and spit in their face
You don't get bank holidays from running the streets
I got carrots and mince pies all stuck in my teeth

It's a treat to be jolly and have something to eat
Screw mistletoe, discovered me fucking a tree
When Santa wants favours he comes running to me
but he's been naughty this year so he gets killed in the face

Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Sanity Valve are good at rapping
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Yeah we get mistle-hoes when we spittin' the flows
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Fucking robbing your wallet and punching your uncle 
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: You'll cry 'cause this Yuletide you'll all die

M:: Father Christmas is a cantankerous <mood-biting??> wanker
Bet he writes the bad cracker jokes while people fire <??> banter
Santa had a blue hat and jacket but he fo-found it boring
Turned to red and now the elves get to do his wrapping for him

That would be awesome, had Mos Prob not gotten there first
Roast my nuts on your chest, 'cause I'm so hot on the verse
Lots of desserts, a Christmas pudding laden with fruit
Santa stole a look and wouldn't even pay when I sued

Getting Yule logs' the only reason why I came here
Different year, same gear, TV and board games here
Get out my fucking chimney, fuck off with your fake beard
Liquid on Mrs Claus' face, that's not rain, dear

The elves should all revolt and simply sack their majesty
The only flaps he's touching are on an advent calendar
Yeah my dick is on your bitch's Christmas gift list
but your sister's getting fisted in the Grinch's kitchen

Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Sanity Valve are good at rapping
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Yeah we get mistle-hoes when we spittin' the flows
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Fucking robbing your wallet and punching your uncle 
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: You'll cry 'cause this Yuletide you'll all die

M:: On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
G:: A PlayStation 3 and HIV
M:: <Stage fright?>, you're wrapped up because it's cold and things
B:: I've got five swollen rings

G:: I spent one day talking 'bout Countdown with my mum
M:: and the next shooting Brussel sprouts out of my bum
G:: Santa is a bastard but Christmas is nice
M:: We'll leave it this year after we switch off the lights

Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on fly
Ding dong merrily on fly
Ding dong merrily on fly
Ding dong merrily on fly
Let's get it

B:: Sanity Valve are good at rapping

Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Fucking robbing your wallet and punching your uncle

B:: Two Gs dealing with business
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Still gangster over Christmas
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: Adapting Christmas folk songs
Chorus:: Ding dong merrily on high
B:: and then we get our swag on
