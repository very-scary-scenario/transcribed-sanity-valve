Five, four, three, two, twelve
Sanity Valve are good

Disclaimer: this mixtape may cause a haemorrhage
a cause to celebrate so please pour a beverage
fixed up, looking sharp, of course the cleverest
you're forgetting the days when we were both irrelevant

Recent developments show these benevolent Gs
reacting to bad press intelligently
the bellend MC would definitely never [??]
to get multiple MOBOs presented to me

Elephant, please, leave the room, we're having discussions
making records to give old people concussions
I don't understand all this swearing and cussing
but I've got Alzheimer's, so I'll go back to me muffin

But they're wacker than puffins, and you know that we're not
we'll set our pubic wigs on fire just to show that we're hot
we're really good, yeah, and we know it a lot
Mos Prob's so hairy he's out back mowing his nob

When I finished sewing it on, we'll get back to business
we're back, operating on the strictest slickness
our victims say 'what kind of ninja is this?'
my dick is on your bitch's Christmas gift list

Bitches lick their lips anticipating Gish's dick
and flick their beans to the point where they splinter wrists
Isn't this really fucking bignchips
his victims say 'what kind of ninja is this?'
we'll piss in your sink, bitch, just to irk you
don't fuck with us or we'll fucking murk you

Mos Prob gets to show off just bezerk
you underrated us and now here's your just deserts
[??] (we'll|will) fucking hurt you in your inner ear
God would save you right now, but he isn't here

My willy [??] for bitches, it never plays right
on the upside, at least their vaginas stay tight
I'm no Shakespeare, but I'm a fucking playwright
equilibrium, conflict, yeah, I'll die of stage fright

Stay right, stand back, this is unplanned attack
no strategy, skills and a bag of raps and a gap
Leave you with minimal kneecaps
now you can't walk, go one, believe that

Three sixty five days spent quite blazed
we're like, 'hey, let's make a really good mixtape'
other rappers' dongs are an Ångström long
compared to ours, 'cause we have ponderous dongs

We used to mention that shit a lot in our songs
we're more confident now, and our nobs are massive
we figured out we'd turn art to shite
somehow we're found two bars behind

Sixteen bars is hard to write
but not for us, 'cause we're fucking tight
we drive around equipment in stolen vans
hunting out bitches to hold our glands

Struggling to pad out the opening track
don't make assumptions; we're dope and it's wack
Mos Prob in the corner, smoking his crack
Gish sitting in a chair, looking totally black

Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
Sanity Valve! We came back!

Empdy produced it faster, we're glourious basterds
this was a bare tune even before it was mastered
people cited our longevity, but we've lasted
any criticism, sticky jism's what we've blasted

Over your mum's chin, suddenly spunking
okay, I didn't last long, but it counts for something
literary beauty, much ado about muff ting
your mum is for shagging and your face is for punching

Empdy proudly presents
Mos Prob and Gish and chips
in Quite Good Rocket Launcher Music
