That's Mos Prob, I'm Gishnchips, don't mess with me
'cause we're S.A.N.I.T.Y.V.A.L.V.E.
We're competent at spelling, like a spelling G
You smell what The Rock's cooking, well he's smelling me

We injure sheep, like we're battering rams
Bear skills, just a smattering, man
We're billingual, though we only speak one language
We're so good at it it counts as two languages

Classically trained Rapmaninoff and Flykovsky
You're rapping in G major but we're majorly G
Like Pearl Harbor, it's plain to see
Partially Def Jam (can't hear what you're saying to me)

Flynochologists, vaginal experts
Even men squirt when they come to hear the next verse
<??> should worry, like finding red sperm
I face fucked your mum so hard her head burst

Approach us with caution, like a testical lump
We put the rap into grape, 'cause we're the best of the bunch
We're seedless; no other rappers exceed us
We're hairy and well hung, just like Jesus

Mos Prob kicking it with Gishnchips
Like 2 Girls 1 Cup we just puke on lips
then shit on tits, the ladies love us
Like <??> we fuck with no rubbers
