That's Mos Prob, I'm Gishnchips, don't mess with me
'cause we're S.A.N.I.T.Y.V.A.L.V.E.
We're competent at spelling, like a spelling G
You smell what The Rock's cooking, well he's smelling me

We injure sheep, like we're battering rams
Bear skills, just a smattering, man
We're billingual, though we only speak one language
We're so good at it it counts as two languages

Classically trained Rapmaninoff and Flykovsky
You're rapping in G major but we're majorly G
Like Pearl Harbor, it's plain to see
Partially Def Jam (can't hear what you're saying to me)
