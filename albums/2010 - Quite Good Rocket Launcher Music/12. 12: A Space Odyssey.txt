Narrator:: And so Sanity Valve grew tired of their time on Earth
They set off in their humble spaceship, Black Dwarf
on an adventure that would change history forever

G:: We're bored of Earth, so we're going,
  B:: bye
G:: We're leaving this planet without knowing
  B:: why
G:: Straight hustle in my space shuttle, know it,
  B:: fly
G:: Straight through the clouds and the flowing
  B:: sky

G:: We're fucking cool and
  B:: Black,
  G:: just like space
The G force of the craft doesn't touch my
  B:: face
G:: 'cause we're the most G force in the galaxy now
The cosmos getting knobbed on by
  B:: Sanity Valve

M:: The humans all love us for huge epic rapping
B:: but we're out,
  M:: space-hunting a new demographic
B:: Popping shots
  M:: with our Glocks, shooting stars
M:: On the Red Planet spitting
  B:: bare Mars bars

M:: Our craft has got
  B:: sixty half-inch
  M:: rims
M:: Saw L. Ron Hubbard, started asking him
Took a bath with him, smoked half
  B:: of a spliff
M:: His ideas aren't something you can argue with

B:: Earth is really shit and gay
so we are going into space
Space is really cool and black
We are really cool and Black

M:: With L. Ron correct, we went on our way
'cause bathing with a sci-fi writer's
  B:: fucking gay
M:: Next stage of our intergalactic holiday
is to hit the moon with Biggie,
  B:: roll a J

M:: Tupac was in attendance so we chilled with them
Discussed our
  B:: superior skills
  M:: with them
M:: Then popped them in the face with a blunderbuss
Who shot Biggie Smalls? Well,
  B:: that was us

G:: No longer would we sit at the back of the bus
We in space, motherfucker,
  B:: now fuck with us
G:: My tachyons bring all the girls to the craft
but we landed on Uranus and we had to laugh

G:: Which lost us our bitches, but that don't matter
Hang on, this is space;
  B:: there is no matter
G:: Meteorite pussies ain't coming near me
We're Sanity Valve, we got
  B:: G-string theory

B:: Earth is really shit and gay
so we are going into space
Space is really cool and black
We are really cool and Black

G:: Leave the solar system 'cause it's getting bare old
'cause in 2012, the sun will claim their souls
Ventured out further, found ourselves a black hole
Comparatively a honky 'cause we got bare lasers

Earth is shit and gay and won't exist soon
so we got the hell out of this solar system
Yeah, you know, by the end of this song
found a new moon for bitches to stroke our dicks on

G:: Yo, yo Mos Prob, you still got some of that Flynapple Express?
M:: Hellsa yeah, I wouldn't go anywhere without that shit
G:: Safe, I think now's the perfect time for a space blunt
M:: We don't have any oxygen, we're not gonna light that thing
G:: Shut up, bitch, I've got a space lighter

G:: Oh shit
M:: Oh shit
G:: Oh shit
M:: Check it out, out the window
Out the space window
G:: Aw, man
M:: Check it, listen
Oh my god, check this out, listen

M:: The end draws nearer, a new dawn, new era
I see things, I see clearer with my whole heart bumping inside
Approach our new home, wiping stardust from our eyes
Behind us, whole solar systems blow up in the skies

On our old planet, left behind nothing but lies
Now we see a newborn planet with so much love in its eyes
New plant species spring up on a daily basis
Fascinating alien races with the strangest faces

Welcome us, with its loving and safe embraces
Finding golden solace in just the strangest places
All these atoms and molecules, straight amazing
Gravity doesn't exist here, float for ages

They avoid war 'cause they know that hate's contagious
They stay, the air is clean, the water's pure
Here's great place to raise our daughters or
the other ones, our sons, new human race

Found a new dwelling place, we were cruising space
[??] never ever abuse or waste it
The cosmos is expansive, we haven't scraped its [subtle] surface
We don't deserve it, but it's there; we'll take it

We've beaten evil in the universe, found the spot
where love was invented and hate forgot
Our spacecraft shattered into shards and pieces
We're so blissfully happy we hardly need it

M:: Aw shit, I forgot a flipping pack of grapes
G:: Well we're just gonna have to go back and get some then, aren't we?

Narrator:: And so Sanity Valve used Teleport
It was super effective
