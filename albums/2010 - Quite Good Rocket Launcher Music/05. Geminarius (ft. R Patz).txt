That's Mos Prob, I'm Gishnchips, don't mess with me
'cause we're S.A.N.I.T.Y.V.A.L.V.E.
We're competent at spelling, like a spelling G
You smell what The Rock's cooking, well he's smelling me

We injure sheep, like we're battering rams
Bare skills, just a smattering, man
We're bilingual, though we only speak one language
We're so good at it it counts as two languages

Classically trained Rapmaninoff and Flykovsky
Not rapping in G major but we're majorly G
Like Pearl Harbor, it's plain to see
Partially Def Jam (can't hear what you're saying to me)

Flynaecologists, vaginal experts
Even men squirt when they come to hear the next verse
Other rappers should worry, like finding red sperm
I face fucked your mum so hard her head burst

Approach us with caution, like a testicle lump
We put the rap into grape, 'cause we're the best of the bunch
We're seedless; no other rappers exceed us
We're hairy and well hung, just like Jesus

Mos Prob kicking it with Gishnchips
Like 2 Girls 1 Cup we just puke on lips
then shit on tits, the ladies love us
Like pencil markings, man, we fuck with no rubbers

Willy so big you're gonna need a bucket
Sanity Valve ain't nothing to fuck with!

Fuck Hiroshima, we're bigger than bombs
we spit sick flows like a river of vom
I'm giving rhythms and witty punchlines
Sometimes I get pissed off and wanna punch Gish like hitting a tom

Snare spectated, with women I'm like a face invader
spend my time dropping lines and slaying haters

â€¦as predicted, the ladies went crazy
They came from all over the world, and some even camped out overnight to get a good spot to meet their hero Robert Pattinson
I get used to hearing the stories, but when you actually hear 'em, people will say
Ah, I've come from Brazil and I've slept out for three nights like WAHEY!
an' like, I dunno, it's completely crazy
The revelation of the evening came from the star himself when he admitted he never really wanted to be an actor
I used to wanna be a rapper

Second part, second half, twenty-one seconds to Mars
like Mickey Rourke or Russell Crowe we're out there wrecking your bars
best in the class, German, maths, French, and the arts
1 Guy 1 Rap, get lyrical glass shards in the arse

We take twelve steps forward, we take twelve steps forward
we can't go back, we're like a homesick abortion
we rhyme twice as nice, therefore we rhyme as a foursome
like me and your mum, who's three men wide, but her boobies are awesome

We're super effective, like a headbutt from Slowpoke
we're dope though, like all of those drugs we don't smoke (stay in school)
like Ian Huntley, 'cause drugs are wack
children, you will very die if you fill your lungs with crack

Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, duck, Sanity Valve
Fuck geese, Sanity Valve are better than geese
Fuck potty training, we keep it wet in the sheets
dropping daddy lyrics all over the pleasantest beats

Sanity Valve have had sex with most of your elderly relatives
and they loved it

Sanity Valve will kill you if it takes all night
and it won't take all night, 'cause we're good at killing
we be illin', drillin' like M.J. but not feeling children
'til my gleaming semen is drippin' down off the ceiling

Several other rappers wanna make like me
'cause I'm sick like I've got a cold and full-blown HIV
so eat and choke on these beats and flows
'cause each of those will proceed to go defeat our foes and breach a throat

We've been here two years and we're still better than veterans
and geese, 'cause Sanity Valve are better than geese
I break and flow, Gishnchips is here, it's time that you know
so grow your minds and listen, let me show you all how it goes

It's Sanity Valve time and you know you can't touch this
we'll be here forever, fuckin' like it or lump it
Something sudden bass is bumping jumping up and fist pumping
one thing leads to one thing other n' fucking everyone's dead

Sanity Valve have had sex with most of your elderly relatives
and they loved it

Oh, shit
Aww, oh shit
Shit
Oh shit
Oh
Aw, sh- a- shit
Hey Gish
Mos Prob
Gishnchips
Mos Prob
Aww, shit
Oh, shit
Hey, Mos Prob

Awwww, shit
