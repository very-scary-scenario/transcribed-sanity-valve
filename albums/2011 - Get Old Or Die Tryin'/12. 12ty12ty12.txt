Living in the future
Tryna make some future money
So we can buy some future things
Go and do some future things

Rapping in the future
Putting 'future' in sentences makes them cool
Fucking your great-grandchildren
and teaching them bad language

It's the year 12ty12ty12, everything's easy
We still haven't made a fucking penny from a CD
Everything hovers, even castles and yoghurt
Making it incredibly hard to eat yoghurt (we not bothered)

We still eat yoghurt, the only remaining dairy product
Mos Prob is a robot with no cock with dope clothes made of photons
and Gishnchips is a digital midget made of widgets
and little bits and crystal shit and silicon

This is wrong, but business is business, and the future shit is kicking off
Flying cars and flying bitches on my aluminium cock
Got a future toaster in the kitchen [dock] that bakes entire pies
That's something to try and form an image of

We're so far advanced from our base stage as primates
The supreme ruler of the world is Graham from Blind Date
and Cilla's still alive, she just broadcasts in mind waves
Can't stop thinking 'bout my toasted pies mate (fill my plate)

Technology and politics developing at rates
We beat the Illuminati with a well-worded letter of complaint
It read: "Dear New World Order, Stop it. Love, Sanity Valve"
Then we set up a way-more-sinister network in its place

Oh, that letter was the angriest, at least Steve Jobs
keeps cranking out high-standard Macs with his iPancreas
and you'd better be thanking us, Steve, or we're intending to shoot you
The present passed the day Sanity Valve invented the future

Living in the future...

You can definitely tell that we rap very well
when in 2012 we managed to end the end of the world
Turns out the future's not orange; the gingers got wiped out
You can think on the oven and mind-switch the lights out

We came from the future, yes we came to shoot you
The human anus has been renamed 'The YouTube'
Complex mind games plays classics, like Who's Who
and global warming never happened. Who knew?

And all of the animals on the brink of destruction
anthropomorphised, then started drinking and fucking (especially pandas)
before their dicks started shrinking to nothing
they expanded loads, bringing the sinister stuff with

There were fucking pandas everywhere, bare pandas
Panda poppies popping up with some limitless expansion
Too many pandas! Just way too many pandas!
But with twelve billion humans, there isn't space for any pandas

Developing their anger, all-up pandamonium
Human babies got eaten if they were left alone with 'em
They grew the thumbs, they learnt to make explosions with
Started a panda corps with a pandictator to reign over it

The bloodshed was very lots; millions were dead and shot
They'd no sooner see your tiny head than fucking tear it off
Hurry the fuck up, Gish, we've got to run to stay alive now
I'm busy right now, there's a panda tearing my eyes out

I miss my toasted pies now, shit, I got dismembered
and pandas fucking killed all the friends that I remembered
A pandemic pandapocalypse, stamping out our achievements
Millions drowned in the seas, mahoosive bereavement

Human hearts ripped out, still ruby and beating
Pandas standing 'round, cackling, amused with the bleeding
Hell opened its bloody jaws, you forsook me, why, God?
Then I woke up and realised I'd lost my fucking iPod

Living in the future...

In the future
