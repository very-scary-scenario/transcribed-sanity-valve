Sanity Valve are from Southend
so you can all fuck off if you're not from Southend

The only way is Essex, I never heard it before
burglars getting burgled before they burst in the door
If you're injecting or infected, you'll love it
'cause everybody's got rabies and the busses are pricey and rubbish

'Cause in town there's a Starbucks, 'cross the road there's a Starbucks
inside that there's a Starbucks, on your face there's a Starbucks
There's no tourist board, you only need to ask us
We'd have escaped sooner but we always miss the last bus

Go to the beach, take Gish to the <??>
'cause <??> scared to piss in the estuary
Sit on the bench next to the sea, drift in memory
penny picker Steve brings with him the stench of wee

The silly homeless bastard interrupted my flow
So I throw 1p coins at him from the other side of the road
It's just a guy that we know, a local icon that shows
how fuckin' lucky I am to live in Brighton and Hove now

I'll never forget my home town
though I'm all bedraggled and hairy and grown now
so proud, oops, wrong route to go down
when they have Salvo the paedo clown

'Cause it's the homeless, the hopeless, decrepit and broken
when you get in the arcade when you're collecting the tokens
Though it's an arse's armpit and it's full of hardship
it's my <garden chips?>, there'll always be a place in my heart for it

Sanity Valve are from Southend

We're not evil people living in sin, we just like pissing in bins
remnants of dirty chicken dribbling down from our chins
Big up Tasty Chicken, the only wrap we don't spit out
Our pastime is watching violent crimes attract a big crowd

This town is loud, who let the kids out?
Kids having kids who have kids who have kids now
Even grandmas running around with their tits out
which wouldn't be so weird except they're, like, twelve

Umm, sorry, that was wack
This ain't a seaside town to surf season <??>
you only need to breathe in to catch herpes

Chavs and the goths are always hangin' by the clock
and Salvo, the paedo, with his dangling cock
I wanna drag him into Starbucks and punch him
then drag him into the other Starbucks and punch him

It's not like staying in hell, it's quite nice
except the people and the place and the smell
The nightlife is quite shite, you can fuck off and die twice
never had a nice time in a nightclub in my life

Chinnerys isn't G, get punched in Mayhem
pay ten quid to rave with underage girls and waste men
Though it's an arse's armpit and it's full of hardship
it was my 'ard shit, there's always a place in my heart for it

Longest pleasure pier in the world (longest pleasure in the whole wide world)
The only team in the world with a one hundred percent record against Manchester United
Hair extensions and STDs (fake tans, HIV)
and stolen goods (KFC)
and buckets of chicken

Sanity Valve are from Southend (yeah, sing it Mos Prob)
you can all fuck off if you're not from Southend (alright)
