Here's a shorlist of things I want to massively injure
including bad sandwich fillers, small hats and the gingers
And no that's not racist, not enough for you to care
ginger people aren't a race they've just got stupid hair

And seagull, you selfish feathered avian dicks
Taking my chips, aiming at my face and taking a shit
Like fat people double teaming both a Flake and a Twix
Twilight isn't good and so (are) people that say that it is

The ex you work with that you've got to avoid
And cucumber, seriously what is the point?
The dickhead you follow out the lift though it's not your level
The generous guy who lets you eat a cocky Revel

The dick who stole my Dairylea and ate all the segments
Or your girlfriend when you punch her in the face when she's pregnant
...I think Mel Gibson's been slipping me lines again

When you push a pull door, mildly disgruntled
When you pull a push door, mildly disgruntled
When the revolving door, it goes round and round and round and round and round and r- mildly disgruntled

Here's some things that make me want to leave children with no heads
when your scrotum gets sweaty, divides and cements to both legs
squeaky ice, polystyrene, banana strings, Cheestrings, 
ingrowing hair and also hairlines that are receding 

Decaf coffee bothers me, it's like having a bit of cake
without the chocolate bit to taste or the buttery biscuit base
And you know what's also proper gay, when you have a good idea
and... fuck, what was I gonna say?

WHEN YOU'RE IN A NIGHTCLUB AND SOMEONE TAKES YOUR HAT OFF
OR WHEN SOME DICKHEAD GETS LIQUID ON YOUR LAPTOP
AND CREATIONISTS, <???> A FAT GOD
AND WHEN YOU ACCIDENTALLY SHOUT A VERSE BECAUSE IT'S IN CAPS LOCK

Shit rappers, dusty DVDs that skip chapters
and them rap battle leagues that don't have paralympic divisions
Michael Buble impersonators, Michael Buble
and cynical wankers who complain about everything... too late

When you push a pull door, mildly disgruntled
When you pull a push door, mildly disgruntled
When the revolving door, it goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round mildly disgruntled
