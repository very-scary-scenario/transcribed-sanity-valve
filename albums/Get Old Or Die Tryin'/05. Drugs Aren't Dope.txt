You be tripping, homey
put down that AIDS needle, you young rapscallion
D- do not take drugs; the- they are a terrible thing for you to be doing

You don't have to be drunk to be bunk
You can get high off of life
All you need is good friends
High five! (clap)
Yeah! Hey kids, listen up to us, we have advice!
Here's a message for all of you

I'm MC Rapper, and I'm a rapper
I'm DJ wicked, 'cause I like the name
The teachers tell you things at school
but you don't think they're very cool

We are the cool team and we're here to say
that drugs are really really gay
and if you take drugs then you are square
now wave your hands in the air like you just don't care

Move your body from side to side
lost count of all the drugs I've tried
and if you take drugs you'll end up like me
sounding really awkward on a '90s beat

Injectable, edible, they're all terrible
if drugs are good then I lack testicles
and I have testicles so they're not
I'll kill you if I catch you smoking a pot

Clap your hands, one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-[incomprehensible]

Don't take drugs, no, drugs are bad
my sister's dead and now I'm sad
don't you smoke drugs 'cause drugs aren't dope
well, drugs are dope, but they're not rad

Don't take drugs, no, drugs are bad
my sister's dead and now I'm sad
don't you smoke drugs 'cause drugs aren't dope
well, drugs are dope, but they're not rad

Listen to your teacher and scrub your shoes
it's not groovy to do drugs abuse
don't be a fool, stay in school
just 'cause Snoop Dogg does it doesn't make it cool

If you do crack then you are wack
you will die and that's a fact
Oh, guess who's back with a brand new rap?
Not you, 'cause you're super dead

You can't be a cool dude like MC Rapper
and you can't be fly like DJ Wicked
show me a pipe and I'll tell you where to stick it
and then I'll punch you for telling me to punch my own ticket

And that is all I have to say
so kids, please be on your way
and I hope you've learnt a lot today
also, animal abuse is bad

Clap your hands, one two three
four five six seven eight nine ten
eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
nineteen twenty twenty-one twenty-[incomprehensible]

Don't take drugs, no, drugs are bad
my sister's dead and now I'm sad
don't you smoke drugs 'cause drugs aren't dope
well, drugs are dope, but they're not rad

Don't take drugs, no, drugs are bad
my sister's dead and now I'm sad
don't you smoke drugs 'cause drugs aren't dope
well, drugs are dope, but they're not rad
