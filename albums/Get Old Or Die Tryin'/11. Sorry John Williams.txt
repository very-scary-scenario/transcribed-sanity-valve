Yeah
You know everybody makes mistakes
Some people kill people (real talk)
some people steal shit
some people start Sanity Valve (word)
I'm one of those people (bless up)
and I'm really sorry (true them)
for all the pain we've caused (hold it down)

Sorry John Williams, for stealin' your shit
Sorry six million, for demeaning Schindler's List
Sorry listeners, for not really givin' a shit
Sorry lyricism for forcing lines that don't fit

Sorry John Williams, for stealin' your shit
Sorry six million, for demeaning Schindler's List
Sorry listeners, for not really givin' a shit
Yours sincerely, Mos Prob, Gishnchips, listen bitch

Many rappers lead a simple life, repenting for the horror
'course Snoop Dogg is smokin' lots of drawer, Necro is makin' horrid porn
and so our souls are purged with even scores before tomorrow's dawn
I suppose it's time to bring up everything we're sorry for

Our first gig was the worst shit, we never rehearsed it
and it featured the world's first hip hop verses with no words in
and the twelve people who sat through this, you deserved this
'cause without you we'd be stupid, we'd be puny and worthless

I apologise for the stupidness of Jewdacris
if he's something that you have missed, fuck yourself, he should never have been doing this
I'm sorry for plugging so bluntly in this way
Now, fuck off to sanityvalve.bandcamp.com, download our mixtapes

Sorry Biggy, didn't mean to shoot him in his face
and all the acts confused to share a lineup with us on a big stage
Sorry for upstaging acts at open mics playing boring shit
and constantly creating offensive and inane choruses

Sorry John Williams, for stealin' your shit
Sorry six million, for demeaning Schindler's List
Sorry listeners, for not really givin' a shit
Sorry lyricism for forcing lines that don't fit

Sorry John Williams, for stealin' your shit
Sorry six million, for demeaning Schindler's List
Sorry listeners, for not really givin' a shit
Yours sincerely, Mos Prob, Gishnchips

Support we received when you first bought our CD is important to me
and would have been all well and good if you guys had got it for free
but in all honesty, I don't even own a copy
hang on, I'm not sorry, you bought it willingly at gigs that went less than swimmingly

The remorse is killing me for the musicians whose ability
is wasted on the ridiculousness presented by Gish and me
All of the heads behind these <seas?> like Empdy and the <G Street Band>
Timbellend, Jazzy Jefferis, you shouldn't be here, literally

Feminism, we apologise to you too, not U2
We support your cause, and think what you do is too cute
Women are more important than just bringing all of our food through
They're also good at cleaning, and have fantastic boobs, too

We apologise to the girls who fucked us 'cause we said we're rappers
we are rappers, but you shouldn't fuck us 'cause we're rappers
I'm sorry for using boring and repetitive rhyme schemes
I just enjoy using boring and repetitive rhyme schemes

Okay, Gish, apologise to the nice people
Yeah, I'm really, really sorry
Really sorry for everything we've ever done
I feel really bad about it
'eally?
Nah, nah fuck that, I don't regret nuffin'
I ain't sorry for shit, you cunts
Look, if you got nothin' nice to say, then shut up and let me rap

We apologise to puffins, complaining with their beaks to the sky
we're not ones to discriminate; we may be equally fly
It's quite absurd to pick on one type of flightless bird-
But Mos Prob, they can fly! Are you fucking kidding me?

Sorry Simon Cowell, Doreen, people who died in our songs
and the Star Wars cast, killing you was violent and wrong
I'm sorry for being indiscreet about the size of my schlong
and ladies, Gish is sorry for the size of his schlong

Sorry for creating awkward situations every time we play shit
and bankrupting nightclubs every time we appear on stages
and for claiming that we're black, seeming that we're really racist
I'll say it one time: I am clearly pasty

Now we've apologised and we will be proper fly
Droppin' rhymes, and rapping with a jot of pride
and Cheryl Cole, sorry, we were wrong about you
but we will never say sorry for Song About- Song About
Poo
