Yo
Fuckin' half-blood crip comin' at your face

I am the dark arts, bitch, you can't defend against them
I'm like muggles, here, try death prevention
Fuck Gryffindor, I'm in the house, I'm blazin' dorms
I wish herbology had taught me these ways before

I stalk the corridors of Hogwarts, spittin' rage
I like wavin' my wand in a witch's face
'cause witches ain't shit but spells and tricks
bitch I'm fly like a snitch, I'm on fire like a phoenix

My Parseltongue's in your mum, my Nimbus 2001
is ready when I need to run, I'm out of here, Wingardium
Leviosa, I'll let you know, err
when I get to the top of the astronomy tower

Fuck you, Dumbledore, I'm the half-blood crip
I'm here with a purpose, and that's to fuck shit up
<??> wanna shave your head, then Avada Kedavra
you're fucking dead

Hey, so, Professor Flitwick's all small
and good at dealing at drugs, so I bought some drugs off of him
and now I'm going to smoke them with my mouth
yep, hairy pothead

I stroke my beard while I'm blazin'
I like staying in, I'm half muggle, half amazing
Too slow for Gryffindor, I sit indoors
thinking thoughts, discussing the Quiddich scores

Whilst Harry and his friends were fighting Voldemort
I'm smoking through the night until I white and roll some more
I wonder how we're actually different from muggles
and why we present them with all of their sickness and struggles
I'm in a bubble and-

Ooh, magic Pringles that we got from the shop
they're like the normal ones, except that you can stop when they pop
Death Eaters go out committin' violent crimes
I have the nicest time, and my life is fine

Tried fighting evil, found it long
Hufflepuffin' magic bud, using owls as bongs
That portrait just spoke t- I think that portrait just spoke to me
I'm not kidding, I'm not kidding
Yeah, they all fucking speak to you, okay? They're magic
Okay, uhh, but, can you just go and sort the noise out outside, please?
No
Please? I'm seriously pranging
Okay

I hear wandfire, all killing and shit
I'm bored, I think I'll roll another spliff in a bit
Whoever it is gets fisted 'til their ribs are split
Fisting's inappropriate, I think you mean punching (oh, shit)

Wizard, please, I'm steppin' out dealing with business
And when you've gone, bring me back some skins, I'm out <of the Rizlas?>
It's that Potter kid, I'll leave broomstick marks on his face, did you know him?
Like, we had potions, I was hardly his mate

What was he like? Well, a touch on the arrogant side
Was banging on about how his entire family died, but that aside
Nah, I'll slap the guy, nah, I don't like him
I know he's Daniel Radcliffe, but there's no need to get violent

I was all up in his grill, Avada Kedavra
there was a tear in his eye as he whispered 'mother, father'
then Voldemort won, it was all shit forever
but we still solid, keeping that clique together

Yo pothead, where the fuck you at, bruv?
Everyone's died, but I don't mind, I found a really nice video of some puppies
