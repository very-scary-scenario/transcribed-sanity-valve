Huh
Ahh
Yeah
Oh
Hey
Yeah
Ha
Aha, aha

Here are a list of things I like about Bono:

Bono can fuck right off and take Chris Martin with him
Bono's so gay he can't even fart without shittin'
He claimed to be feeding the weak and keeping peace in the East
but you mo' cheesy than feet and mo' greasy than grease

It's not racist, just phonetically awkward
You are racist, and you pathetic and boring (bellend)
I fuckin' hear him there, wanking a towel
Your glasses are worse than those worn by Sanity Valve

My clothes are rather good, your clothes ain't half as good
I bet you worked foreign kids in your own sweatshop, then fucked them afterward
Another reason I chuffing hate this bitch (huh)
It's your fuckin' fault that Coldplay exists

It's a beautif-

I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
Oh, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, aha, yeah

You don't deserve the two YouTube views I gave you to abuse you
Bono, I choose you to get punched by Mewtwo
Pin you down with my knees, scrape my poo on your face
Gouge your eyes out with forks, that's a beautiful day

These lyrics are now true, though considered a bit harsh
you've got as much swagger as Alan Titchmarsh
I'm ill when I spit bars, your life is a shit farce
I could live with or without you, ha, without the 'with' part

We're livin' on the edge, you're jizzin' in The Edge
why don't you save the whole world while I piss on your head
I hate U2 (me as well?) nah, that's fuckin' wrong
we explored our beef in another song, you utter mong

Now back to Bono, what an absolute cunt
His name is 'onob' backwards, what an absolute cunt
Fuck Bono, fuck Lidl, but mostly fuck Bono
He makes me really angry, oh, fuck bono

It's a beautif-

I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
Oh, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, aha, yeah

I got Bono in the car
I drive the car off a building
I push the building on the car
Just to make sure we killed 'im

Oh, Bono, what an absolute c-
Bono, what an absolute c-
Bono, what an absolute c-
Bono, what an absolute cunt-
Bono, what a

It's a beautif-

I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
Oh, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, aha, aha, yeah

I <??> Joshua Tree (Achtung Baby)
I hate U2, Bono I hate U2
Oh, Bono I hate U2
I hate U2, aha, aha, haha

I still haven't found what I'm looking for
