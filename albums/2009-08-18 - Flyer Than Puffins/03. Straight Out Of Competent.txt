G:: Got more moneys and more legs than Heather Mills
Like Werner Herzog we got bear skills
If you don't like me, you can suck my steely wood
'cause we put the G back into really good

J:: I'm blacker than Darth Vader and iller than swine flu
I'm like that chap from Memento, we shouldn't have to remind you
I got bare blades like ice skating equipment
I get more ladies than Harold Shipman

G:: We've got more swagger than a man with rickets
and we've got bare wheels like the Paralympics
We offend more people than my fascist grandma
and we're still more child-friendly than NAMBLA

J:: What's the time, mister wolf?
It's Sanity Valve time, and we're better than you
Got more G than the alphabet, because that's only got one
whereas we've got two

G:: Got more lyrics than James Brown, 'cause he's dead and we're not
Hahahahaha, you're dead and we're not
That means that we're technically better than James Brown
'cause he can't be fly if he's really dead

J:: We're more aggressive than Janet Street-Porter
we make women wetter than when they're breaking water
We're cooler than placentas
J:: That was completely uncalled for

G:: We're sexier than children
J:: Gish! You can't say that!
There's literally no way on God's green Earth that you can put that on an album!
Why am I in a band with you?
  G:: Okay

G:: We're cooler than-
J:: You know what? I'm not actually gonna let the- the children thing ride, okay? Really!
G:: That's not what I said, haha!
J:: Oh, for God's sake
Here's a chorus

G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
J:: you'll like us
  B:: 'cause we're competent at rapping
G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
J:: you'll like us
  B:: 'cause we're
  A:: competent, competent

G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
B:: you'll like us 'cause we're competent at rapping
G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
B:: you'll like us 'cause we're competent, competent

J:: Yeah

G:: Our massives are massive and our knobs are still bigger
go figure, my cock's a lot, and I've got an itchy trigger finger
We've had more sex with your mum than the general public
That's a lot of sex because your mum has a lot of sex

J:: Our tunes are bigger than Obama's ears, we have
more sex than a farmer's rear
We're better than Shakespeare at rapping
Iambic pentameter? More like flyambic pentametizzle

G:: We've spent more time in correctional facilities than Tipp-Ex
You think Bruce Lee's buff? Check out these pecs
We're also better than Bruce Lee, 'cause he's also really dead
A- actually, he was pretty good

J:: Insane in the membrane?
More like Sanity Valve are proficient at their trade
and when we go bananas we go fair trade
and we don't oppress farmers, 'cause we know that's bare gay

G:: Ha ha, farmers are rubbish because they get oppressed
we're in tertiary industries, so we're the best
We've been smeared on more women's chests than a Cleveland Steamer
and Jay-Z's worse than us, he even dreams of semen

J:: We got better rhymes than the psalms in the bible
we're sexier than Susan Boyle, that's undeniable
We're more flawless than flawless, more diverse than diversity
when your bird sees me she squirts at me like having bursts of wee

G:: We're tricker than a Rubik's Cube
want a Jackson 5 wig? You can use his pubes
we're just the grooviest dudes at abusing noobs
we're just oozing tunes and we can prove it too

J:: I stroke more puppies than a five-year-old child
I just touched a daffodil and then I smiled
This song might make you think that we're pure evil
but we're not, we're nice people, you knob

G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
B:: you'll like us 'cause we're competent at rapping
G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
B:: you'll like us 'cause we're
  A:: competent, competent

B:: We're really good
we're competent at rapping
you'll like us 'cause we're competent at rapping
G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
you'll like us 'cause we're competent, competent

J:: Let's say it again, 'cause it's important

G:: We're really good
B:: we're competent at rapping
you'll like us 'cause we're competent at rapping
We're really good
we're competent at rapping
you'll like us 'cause we're
  G:: competent,
  B:: competent

B:: We're really good
we're competent at rapping
you'll like us 'cause we're competent at rapping
We're really good
we're competent at rapping
G:: we're really good
