(children cheering)

We’re gonna go to Woolworths to get some pick ’n’ mix
Oh no, wait, we’re not, because Woolworths is shit
Sweet as fuck

You'd better believe that we eat pick 'n' mix
You hate Teeth and Lips you’ll have beef with Gishnchips
We buy a whole bagful and shove it in our faces
We can’t get enough of them strawberry laces

Yeah, we’re just big pimps who like pink shrimps
We ditch small packs we want the biggest
We’re big kids all up in the sweet shop you dig this
excitement when we lift the lids

Without sweets we can’t function, like invalids
fill the pack with some blackjacks and liquorice
Flying saucers, giant strawberries, and minty things
I know a bad band, let’s badmouth The Ting Tings

Flumps and Flumps and more Flumps and Flumps
They’re the nicest and the lightest and they don’t cost much
Gish, I believe your current choices aren’t valid
Take out the healthy shit like choc raisins and Fruit Salad

This won’t count towards your five a day
Want an appropriate sweety? Then try a gay
That’s not a sweety, stop trying to deceive me
Say the insult directly if you want to aggrieve me

Oh let’s not bicker at the pick and mix bit
look, don’t besmirch it with your Gishnips
They’re pink shrimps! I’ll punch you in the bitchtits
That banana’s not made from real banana, is it?

No Gish, it’s a confectionery item
So it’s a lump of sugar with lots of chemical shite
aha, you’re a nob gobbler your mum I'm on top of her
Like balls in your mouth? Try a gob stopperer

Why this sudden onslaught of abuse?
I’m sad, I might go home and end myself with a noose,
this torrent of insults has become more than enough,
I want to cry! Gish is a hairy muff

Yay!
Sweeties am fun
Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For everyone
(x4)

We’re really good at rapping and eating sweets
Jewdacris hurts me with words and feet
Hey, Gishnchips, you whiff slightly of smeg
Does your uterus ovulate Haribo eggs?

Ooh, you’re whiter than white mice
Try this it’s nice, it looks like an orange slice
But by this time I was boiling with rage
I wanted to grab a sweet scoop and start spoiling his face

Hey Gish, have a rhubarb and custard
How dare you? They make me poo hard, you bastard
Ha ha ha, I gave your mum a candy necklace
It’s like a pearl necklace, but not referring to jizz

But just as I was about to rip out his spleen
An enthusiastic young shop attendant intervened
Hey chaps, you seem like chipper guys
You type of either kind who like to try prior to buying

But… please don’t eat our shit

Yay!
Sweeties am fun
Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For everyone
(x2)

Yay!
Sweeties am fun
Yay!
Sweety…s
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For every- one

Yay!
Sweeties am fun
Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For everyone

“What?” I said frustratedly
