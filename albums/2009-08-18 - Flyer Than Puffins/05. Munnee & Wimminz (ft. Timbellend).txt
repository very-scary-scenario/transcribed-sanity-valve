J:: Whoa
Whoa-oh, I got a nipple erection
on my nipples
I got nipples

Timbellend:: Never gonna give you up
never gonna let you down 
  J:: that is off the chart mate
never gonna run around
and desert you
  J:: sexually attractive

Shorty I'm never gonna make you cry
never gonna say goodbye
  J:: bitches want our willies
never gonna tell a lie
and hurt you
  J:: fucking word

G:: Yo, yo
I'd quite gladly take you home to meet my mum
Nice one! You got quite a nice bum
J:: I like you so much I changed my status on Facebook to
your left nipple's quite pleasant, the right is rather good too

G:: I remember that time we were playing on Mega Drive
you said you didn't like Street Fighter and I felt dead inside
then you turned to me, grinned, and said you lied
and I laughed
  J:: lololol omg
  G:: 'cause it was funny

G:: Deal with the fact that I might be immature
I think I like your hair, but I need longer to decide for sure
  Timbellend:: ooh
You'd be so cute if you were pixelated
I've lost count of the times I've thought of you when I've masturbated
  Timbellend:: Never gonna give, never gonna give

G:: Boobies soft like Lara Croft you make me more than hard enough
like Half-Life you chip layers of my armour off emotionally speaking
but we do have sex sometimes
  J:: mmm
  G:: and this is nice
because sex is really nice

G:: It's nice to find a gaming opponent who doesn't fight back
Your nose is oddly shaped, yeah, but then I like that
I'm a nice lad, if you broke your leg I'd bring an ice pack
not for your leg, I'd shove it up your arse crack
  J:: hahaha
  G:: just for lols

G:: You're the person of my dreams
your farts smell nice and they're like Krispy Kremes
or potpourri, or peelable cheese
or flowers and trees, or other things that smell nice

You're the type of girl I'd make a mixtape for
if cassettes were still widely available in stores
I'd quite happily go about destroying your one ring
  Jewdacris with a lot of reverb:: you shall not pass
G:: but I'd take a brief shortcut to get straight through to Mordor

I'm quite fond of you, yeah I'm not Barry White
but I can turn fat, black, and dead if you want me to
and with this poor taste reference to the Love Walrus
  Timbellend:: ooh
G:: now's as good a time as any to take it to the chorus

Timbellend:: Never gonna give you up
never gonna let you down
  J:: let you down like a failed erection
Timbellend:: never gonna run around
and desert you
  J:: like an ice cream with legs

Timbellend:: Shorty I'm never gonna make you cry
  G:: mmm
  J:: like AIDS
Timbellend:: never gonna say goodbye
  J:: like AIDS
  G:: mmm
Timbellend:: never gonna tell a lie
and hurt you
  J:: like AIDS

Timbellend:: Never gonna give you up
  G:: uhh
  J:: yeah
Timbellend:: never gonna let you down
  G:: and other sex noises
Timbellend:: never gonna run around
  J:: watch out, women
Timbellend:: and desert you
  J:: because Sanity Valve are here, and we attract women
  G:: we do

Timbellend:: Shorty I'm never gonna make you cry
  J:: so watch out for- for us, when we attract you
Timbellend:: never gonna say goodbye
never gonna tell a lie
  G:: mmh!
Timbellend:: and hurt you
  J:: it goes like this

J:: Because some folk might potentially find it quite ghastly
what I've done to that popular ditty by Rick Arsetly
In my opinion, you are my baby doll
and I can only express how I feel via a Rickroll

And I don't want to seem too forward and crude
but like Rick, I'd like fourteen million hits in your tube
I think about your earlobes, like, all the time
I'd please you with a socked foot if you'd be mine

Timbellend hitting it with the remix
and he'd be in agreement
  G:: yeah?
  Timbellend:: nice tits
J:: I'm super and a man like Brandon Routh
I like my testicles and they belong in your mouth
  Timbellend:: Never gonna give, never gonna give

J:: I'm from down south, but you're from heaven
your labia hangs slightly, but I like minge unleavened
  Timbellend:: uhh
J:: I had the sex talk when I was seven
so I'm good at sex
  G:: at sex

J:: I don't do misogyny like
  B:: bitch make me a sandwich
J:: but I'm quite hungry and would appreciate a sandwich
if I was gay I would get myself a man, bitch
but I'm not, I like
  B:: boobies and flanges

J:: You're so attractive, you could sell perfume
or double glazing, 'cause it's sexist to assume
You'd look fantastic stuffed on my mantelpiece
my testicles are huge, you can't handle these

I want you all over my face
that is where I want you: all over my face
if you weren't all over my face
then my face would be without you upon it

For you I'd goatse, stretch my botty hole to its limit
my life would probably be quite different if you weren't in it
for you, I'd even do a turd in a cup
  Timbellend:: ooh
  G:: what the fuck?
J:: Now the verse has ended

Timbellend:: Never gonna give you up
never gonna let you down
  J:: like a crack addiction
Timbellend:: never gonna run around
and desert you

Shorty I'm never gonna make you cry
  J:: like AIDS
Timbellend:: never gonna say goodbye
  J:: like Belgium when we nuke Belgium
Timbellend:: never gonna tell a lie
and hurt you

Never gonna give you up
never gonna let you down
  J:: Sanity Valve
Timbellend:: never gonna run around
  J:: have- have sex with women
Timbellend:: and desert you
  J:: and kill people

Timbellend:: Shorty I'm never gonna make you cry
  J:: primarily, though, we have sex with women
Timbellend:: never gonna say goodbye
  J:: and kill people
Timbellend:: never gonna tell a lie
and hurt you

J:: Yeah, anyone who isn't us is really bad at having sex with women
G:: Sanity Valve are here, so lock up your daughters like Josef Fritzl
J:: Bitches want our willies
G:: Hoah!
J:: Gish, pass the Kleenex
