?:: Aww!
Shit!

J:: Hip hop is at the roots, comes from the core
can't go anywhere without knowing where you've been before
tellin' it when you're developing if anything you can't be sure
but from the disease of ignorance there is a proven cure

It lies in knowing all about plague and war
and poverty and pain and street urchins and whores
people say to us, yeah, you rhyme hardcore
you're childhood's gotta be good, and that's fo' shiz

G:: Then we agree and we say yes
that is true, certainly correct
wanted a Scalextric and this train set stinks
a poo, and bums, and willies and things

I wanted a red Power Ranger, I got the blue one
FIFA's shit, it doesn't count because you won, poo-bum
no, mum, I won't wash my hands
because I wanted Haribo, you got me Tesco's own brand

Harry's mum got him a Dreamcast, why can't I?
Fuck the beach, I hate the beach, I get sand in my eye
I don't want to go, I want to play PC, it doesn't please me
it's not fast enough to run Quake III

J:: I want to get the bus home on my own
I haven't even got a phone with polyphonic ringtones
Harry's allowed to watch eighteen-rated films, you make me sick
you've blocked all the porn on the web, how will I operate my dick?

Monopoly is balls, I don't like any of you
I want to hear the Vengaboys, how dare you put on Kajagoogoo
you tell me violence is nasty so Street Fighter's lame
yet you force Frustration on me, that's a violent game

Grandma leaves lipstick all up on my cheek
I only need to brush my motherfucking teeth once a week
Shut up, I'm not really gay
  G:: (you're gay)
J:: No, shut up, I'm not really gay

G:: Charlotte wouldn't hold my hand she said that I smell
and that I didn't use enough hair gel
well look at me now, I'm a half-famous rapper
hahahahahahahahahahahaha

Mum, you're a shit cook, I want McDonald's for real
you don't give me a new toy with every meal
I don't want to play sports at school
I want to play PlayStation not basketball

J:: No, mum, I won't tidy my bed, you tidy my bed
and make my dinner, bitch
No, not fish fingers, I don't want fish fingers
they taste like shit and I don't like them

And the batteries on my Game Boy always used to die
at inconvenient times and it made me cry
on the Super Mario level with the aeroplane it bare was lame
then I always lost the game

G:: Oh no, I just lost The Game
no mum, not fish fingers again
my sister is a gay because she has a flange
I don't want G.I. Joe, I just want Action Man

Harry's parents beat him why can't you do that to me
instead of not letting me watch CITV
There was one time when I really needed a poo
and you blocked the door so I did a shit on the floor
  J:: (haha you shit)

G:: It's not funny, alright?
I was genuinely traumatised
J:: No, it was not me who smeared crayon all in the settee
Of course it was the fucking goldfish

G:: You want some fish fingers?
J:: No, I don't want fish fingers!
J:: D- d- remember, whether bad or not
Always remember where you came from
