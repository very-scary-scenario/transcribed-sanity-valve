Gishnchips, I just heard the flap
- Vagina?
No, theâ€¦ flap, the- the letter box
- Oh I see
I think it's the letter
- The letter?
Maybe today will be the day that all of our dreams come true
- Oh, I really hope so Jewdacris
Let's open it
- Let's!
Using a bare blade
- Here, use my bare blade
Let- let's read it, c'mon

We camped outside the O2 arena, it was uncomfortable
We should have got through to the final because we're really cool
The judges refused to acknowledge that we are really good
now we think that they are utter knobs, they're utter knobs

Dear Sanity Value, thanks for applying to X Factor
but you must prepare to have all of your dreams shattered
we don't want you on our show, you're not what we're looking for
your clothes were really fly, but your rapping was really poor (what's this?)

I much preferred <???>, he'd make a good track
that's why he made it through, despite being pretty wack
now, Jewdacris, you had a number of skills
they were just about enough for you to pay the bills

But Gishnchips, you were just awful
so far off from being slightly ill (bastard)
go away and practise, come back next year
but Jewdacris, you'd be far better off without that other queer

I'd just like to thank you for entering this time 'round
I liked your sound, but your rapping skills weren't really down
I hope this rejection doesn't make your whole lives foul
signing off now, the one and only Simon Cowell

We camped outside the O2 arena, it was uncomfortable
We should have got through to the final because we're really cool
The judges refused to acknowledge that we are really good
now we think that they're utter knobs, they're utter knobs

What? This is really unfair
we're magnificent rappers and we have brilliant hair
Our threads are way dope and people really like them
ladies always want to have sex with what's inside them

I can't believe that they've turned us away
Simon is gay, Cheryl's gay, and Louis Walsh is fucking gay
Oh my days, we're gonna show 'em
when our words hit them they're not even gonna know 'em

We're gonna have to think of something to teach those guys a lesson
everybody got to know the Valve ain't for messin'
everybody else finds our skills impressive
we got to do something to keep them interested

How about we kill a man?
Gishnchips, don't be a berk
How about we kill a girl?
Gishnchips, that might just work
To pull this off though, it's gotta be a girl that he knows
Well isn't it blindingly obvious? We kidnap Cheryl Cole

We camped outside the O2 arena, it was uncomfortable
We should have got through to the final because we're really cool
And judges refused to acknowledge that we are really good
now we think that they are utter knobs, they're utter knobs

Hey, Simon, remember Sanity Value?
well we're back, and we're going to kill you
well we're not, because you've got a lot of bodyguards
we're gonna kill Cheryl Cole instead because she has slightly less bodyguards (no, fuckin' 'ell like)

We're driving to the river, she's in the boot of our car
we're driving pretty fast and we're diving in pretty far
she may have been voted one of the world's sexiest women
but all the doors are locked, so good luck swimmin'

At first, I was scared about killing her in this way
so I cut myself another slice of cheesecake
and now I feel better and I'm ready to do this
'cause we're the true winners, our careers are gonna live through this

Like Biggie and Tupac, we'll be bigger when we're dead
all children will admire us and wear similar threads
we gotta go now, Simon, 'cause we're almost at the bridge now
oh yeah, our last words, your trousers are high and you're a knob

Dear Sanity Valve, apologies for the misprint, can't believe we did it
it was a schoolboy error, that Simon is a big tit
we shouldn't let our receptionist drink in a professional context
but we accidentally kicked you out instead of JLS

who were really shit, but we know you can do this
with enough encouragement, you can be the next Leona Lewis
amongst the hoards of eager beavers sleeping outside the arena
you were world pleasers, the rest smelt like Cleveland Steamers

We cried and we cried over miss Cole's untimely demise
with tears in our eyes, we tried and we tried and we tried to replace her
we traced her, but it was a lost cause
and we were gonna have to resort to bringing back Sharon Osborne

So we cancelled the show, but just so you know
we're so sorry to have kept tossing you to and fro
so here's the good news, if you've heard, in case you haven't
you chaps are in the final of Britain's Got Talent

Fuck, you're dead
