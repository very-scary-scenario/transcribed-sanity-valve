Yeah, Sanity Valve, all up in the shops and stuff
Tell them, Gish and also chips
Fuck Lidl

Even gangsters have bodily needs
it's not greed, we're just not too posh to nosh and feed
some appetites can't be satisfied with a fizzy drinks dispenser
it's sometimes better to head straight to Marks and Spencer

or Morrisons, I'm sorry son, the decision's an economic one
we had to let [??] in the taste of our chicken goujons
it's nice to shop budget, 'til you've tried it you can't knock it
worth it for the feeling of shrapnel in your back pocket

In fact, sod it, the sound of automatic doors
you head straight through the fruit and veg bit; we're not herbivores
we just ignore anything without excessive calories
don't get mad at me and warn me about some gastric malady

If I leave here without four pints of milk, it's a catastrophe, a tragedy
read the back of the pack to check for allergies
buy a new shaver, crack out triple-A batteries
and a newspaper, crisps, and a fat pack of cheese

Go to the deli and grab some grilled anchovies
and a spot of brie the spotty employee hands to me
couple of the Lotto slips for Friday, it could be me apparently
according to the giant blue hand that be

Then the [??] continue with the week's shop
I only buy stuff that's kosher, this flipping beef's not
Beef's completely legit, in fact I plan on eating it
before you say some freaky shit, revise the flipping Torah script

You've got whore-arse nips, you've got fat gash lips
Oh, please be quiet, and let's continue with this shopping trip
Ooh, look at that vase, it's bitching, I'm itching
to have daisies on display in the motherflipping kitchen

Listen, Gishnchips, I didn't come to get peripherals
I came to stock my body with vital vitamins and minerals
Gishy knows, I don't wanna get bitches and hos
I know we're only here for some fishsticks and some rolls

Yeah, yeah, we don't stop
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Asda or Co-op
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Awesome online shopping's not
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Yeah
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
The weekly shop
Checkout

All smiles, running 'round the aisles, shopping with my shopping trolley
throw in some dolly mixtures, and even some flipping lollies
Jewdacris, can we get some Marmite, 'cause it are good?
No, Gishnchips, it are shite

I want some yeast extract! Then just grab some flipping Nik Naks
Oh, I want Hula Hoops! Well then shut up and grab a ten pack
Whoa, calm down man, shall I get you a Tampax?
No

We've got what we need, so let's head to till number eight
behind the girl on rollerskates, yeah man, we've got hella waits
Oh, flip, Jewdacris, I forgot a flipping pack of grapes
Then go grab some then, you semi-developed ingrate

Get back to the till, I'm slightly perspiring
the size of this store, man, it's so damn tiring
back to the till, flying ting, fuzzled all my wiring
cashier, she's hanging there, trying to sing

Doreen, sitting there, senile, a blank stare
she were bare gash for someone who had blue rinse hair
Excuse me, fellas, do either of you chaps have a Nectar card?
Shut up and pack my goods or I'll shoot you in the rectum, hard!

The cashier says the Maestro card's backfiring
Oh, we'll never be out before the pastries are expiring
come on Jewdacris, we've got to do something
I'm desperate to get this foodizzle in my tummy

Look, Gishnchips, I know you get easily bored
but remember when we raided Leigh Library with a double-edged sword?
Hey man, I've got me a game plan, this ain't bad
I just can't be flipped to wait this long, man

I pulled out my Beretta, I stuck it to her face
No, Gishy, don't shoot Doreen in the face
So I shot her in the tits, grabbed the stuff, and legged it
Balls, this is worse than that time in Budgens, isn't it?

Yeah, we don't stop
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Asda or Co-op
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Doreen's breastless but she's still hot
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Yes
Sanity Valve like the weekly shop
Sanity Valve enjoy shopping occasionally (x4)

Oh, bollocks, we forgot the bananas
Well you're just gonna have to use a cucumber instead, then, aren't you?
