(children cheering)

We’re gonna go to Woolworth’s to get some Pick ’n’ Mix 
Oh no wait we’re not because Woolworth’s is shit
Sweet as fuck

You better believe that we eat Pick and Mix
You hate “teeth and lips” you’ll have beef with Gishnchips
We buy a whole bagful and shove it in our faces
We can’t get enough of them strawberry laces

Yeah, we’re just big pimps who like pink shrimps
We ditch small packs we want the big [?]
[We’re?] big kids all up in the sweet shop you dig this
[???] when we lift the lids

Without sweets we can’t function like invalids
[Through?] [packs of] blackjacks and liquorice
Flying saucers, giant strawberries and minty things
I know a bad band, let’s badmouth The Ting Tings

Flumps and flumps and more flumps and flumps
They’re the nicest and the lightest and they don’t cost much
Gish, I believe your current choices aren’t valid
Take out the healthy shit like chopped raisins and fruit salad

This won’t count towards your five a day,
[?] an appropriate sweety and try again

That’s not a sweety, stop trying to deceive me
Say the insult directly if you want to aggrieve me
Oh let’s not bicker with the pick and mix bit 
Look don’t [dismerch???] it with your Gishnips

They’re pink shrimps 
I’ll punch you in the bitchtits
That banana’s not made from real banana, is it?

No gish, it’s a confectionary item,
So it’s a lump of sugar with lots of chemical shite
Ah, you’re a knob gobbler your momma on top of a
Like balls in your mouth try a gob stoppler

Why this sudden onslaught of abuse,
I’m sad, I might go home and end myself with a noose,
this torrent of insults has become more than enough,
I want to cry

Gish is a hairy muff

(chorus)
Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For everyone

(chorus x3)

We’re really good at rapping and eating sweets
Jewdacris hurts me with words and feet
Hey Gishnchips you whiff slightly of smeg 
[???] useless ovulate Haribo eggs

Ooh you’re whiter than white mice
Try this it’s nice, it looks like an orange slice

But by this time I was boiling with rage
I wanted to grab his sweets [???] and start spoling his face

Hey Gish, have a rhubarb and custard
How dare you, they make me poo hard your bastard

Ha ha ha I gave your mum a candy necklace,
It’s like a pearl necklace, but not referring to jizz

But just as I was about to rip out his peen
An enthusiastic young shop attendant intervened

Hey chaps, you seem like chipper guys 
who seem to like the kind who like to try try before buying???

But…please don’t eat our shit.

(Chorus x2)

Yay!
Sweeties and fun
Yay!
Sweety…s
Yay!
Sweeties are fun
Yay!
For everyone

(Chorus x1)

“What?”
I said frustratedly
