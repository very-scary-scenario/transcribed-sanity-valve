Sanity Valve (Oooh)
(? i feel ???)
Yeah

Getting ready to go out
A fearful venture
Oh my will we look fly 
or merely pretentious?

Of course we'll look buff
to generate attraction 
we've got huge knobs and shoot people
and we'll get action

But there's one thing that's starting to bug me
no girl could love me due to the fact that I'm fuck ugly

That- that's not true

That has given me hope, thank you Jewdacris
No probs Gishnchips, now let's be doing this
We get to the club, the prices are extortion
Red Bull is ten pounds so we stick to tap water

Most of the girls in here are fat and have daughters
You got herpes last time you were here, well that taught you
No it didn't, I want another STI
I can aquire one, because I'm a sexy guy, Just kidding

I'll mate like a leprechaun
and wear two condoms to be sure, to be sure
I suddenly realise I don't wanna have sex
I look down at my penis, it's no longer erect

There's a spiky-haired chap who was giving me beef
And an ingrowing toenail that's giving me grief
I don't want to find a girl to do a mess on her chest
I don't want to undress I just want to play chess

I'm emotional, and I know that I miss you
Even when I wank I end up moping after the tissue
Gish, she's grinding on me pretend you're gay too
She says "are you gay", no I just don't like you

I won't grind you I won't even try to
Your friends are nice though, would they like a slice too?
Then I realise I'm saying this in my head,
and I've given the wrong impression because I've got an erection

When we're in public dancing establishments 
women find us attractive when we're
all up in this joint (we are)
all up in this joint

When we're in public dancing establishments 
women find us attractive when we're
all up in this joint (we are)
all up in this joint

all up in this joint
a-a-all up in this joint (word up)

It's about midnight things are a bit shite
I just heard Black Eyed Peas for the fifth time
We'd keep this tight and make sure that it rhymes
But other rappers can't be bothered

If you ask me to dance in a dance track then I won't dance
If you ask a girl to grind on me you've got no chance
If you ask me to drink, I'll stay sober
If you're Akon I'll punch you in the knob

I can dance fly enough to a song about pottery
Lots and lots of (???) frontal lobotomies
Get a lot of girls, that's not my world
Cos if you talk about ladies I've not got a lot of these

(????????)
She's got meat in her drawers (???)
Looks up and smiles but she's got no teeth in her jaw
Her boyfriend looks at me and says "well that's a treat for the whore"

Cos bitches ain't shit, but men are worse
I'll have sex with a lady at least I'll tell her first
But right now, I just want to converse
and not reimburse the contents you dropped in her beef purse

By half eleven I'm bored, I got in at ten past
I'm just sick and tired of watching aging men dance
Behind underage girls trying to get in their pants
Techno then trance and then techno then trance

Because unlike us, the night must be stressful
