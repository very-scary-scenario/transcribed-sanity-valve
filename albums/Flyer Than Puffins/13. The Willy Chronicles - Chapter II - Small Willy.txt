One and two and three and four and
Yes

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
Woo!

My willy's very small but I don't mind it
it still does the job when I can find it
It looks like it's folded back inside itself
I have to look so close I'm nearly blinded

Picture a pea, well that's bigger than me
It's only got one eye but even it can see
that it's really really really tiny
'cause my willy is small, it's a miniature willy

Let me tell you what it's like when my willy is erected
It grows to a size beyond what is expected
Next to me, other men feel dejected
Actually, no, it's still small, I stand corrected

Don't despair, at least it's there
It's even got hair, so girls, be fair
My willy is small, but it doesn't matter
'cause I'm a competent rapper

The size of my willy's overshadowed by my skills
because it's those skills what pays the bills
I'm the size of a lentil but my lyrics are mental
Mock it, I'll be all up in your grills

I've heard it said "you need a big willy to rap"
but whoever said this: shut your trap
I'm quite happy with the small size of my chap
and I can rap well, so there

Now I know that it's just because I'm with Jewdacris
and there are gonna be expectations regarding this
Don't assume that just because I'm with him
that I'm necessarily gonna fill your quim

I may not satisfy with what's packed inside my fly
but I make up for it by looking really fly
It's not really a big problem that my
willy is small

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
what have I got?
A small willy

I've got a small willy
got a small willy
Mmm

Why is it a bad thing that my willy is small
'cause surely that means that you can take it all?
I can still give you pleasure in unquestionable measure
with my tiny willy and my tiny balls

I'm not sure why people don't believe in me
My sex skills don't get much credibility
I don't think you should judge my ability
on simply how big my willy be

"It's what's inside that counts," is the oft-said phrase
but that only applies to girls and gays
With real men, it's what's on the outside
and my outside often causes outcry

Hand me a thimble and I can definitely fill it
and girls have been known to say "that's the ticket"
but I have the problem that men don't respect me
All they ever seem to want to do is deck me

They push me in the playground, they mock me in the street
Some ran up behind me, pull my pants down to my feet
They always made sure that everybody saw
what it was that I was being mocked for

One day, I got emailed by a guy I'd never met before
Said I didn't have to feel the hurt any more
I went down to his clinic, that's where he did it
He made my willy big and now I get respect, innit?

My willy's now so big I had to buy some new briefs
Now I also have to buy a bigger size in sheets
Short shorts? Totally out of the question
People in the streets say, "Wow! God really blessed him"

I impress them. My willy now interests them
and you notice in which direction I am dressing
No more is anybody disrespecting me
because my willy is big

I've got a big willy
got a big willy
what have I got?
A big willy!

I've got a big willy
got a big willy
what have I got?
A big willy!

I've got a big willy
got a big willy
what have I got?
A big willy!

I've got a big willy
got a big willy
what have I got?

Yay! I've got a big willy
Yay! I've got a big willy
Yay! I've got a big willy
Finally! I've got a big willy

I've got a big willy
I've got a big willy
I had a small willy
but now I've got a big willy

Yes!
