All over America you could hear studios panicking
Lucas isn't dead, let's bring Star Wars back again
having to follow the backstory of Anakin
but have him played by a shop window mannequin

but have him begin as this bow haired kid on Tatooine
and so his ascension to an evil twat begins
we'll rake it in, fuck everything up with CGI
Lucas made me cry, he should have the force like a Jedi

People are allowed to make bad films because at least they've tried
murdering Star Wars was cultural genocide
but Darth Sidious was an <???>
<???> with syphilis

Liam Neeson was decent enough as Qui-Gon Jin
but Guinness was a better Obi-Wan, so why not him?
I want to witness the Guinness, forget the McGregor
and get the emperor played by Schwarzenegger

Keep your pit droids, keep your <???> pod race
I want Harrison Ford firing oodles of lasers
and Jabba the Hut smelling strongly of Quavers
and what the fuck is a mida-chlorian

Natalie playing Padmi, you could have had me
but you probably wouldn't have died in Episode III
I don't kill babies or commit genocide
and I'm not Darth Vader, so won't you be my bride

But what about comic relief? Haha, thinks
oh wait, it wasn't funny, it was Jar Jar Binks
I wouldn't end that prick with a Jedi mind trick
I would snap his face off 'til he bled to death with my dick

Pull his eyeballs out, snap his goddamn neck
set Threepio on him with his homoerotic subtext
make him wish he'd never been shat into life without being a twat
so he could sell lunch boxes and make his wallet fat

and Jar Jar Binks is really shit

and Jar Jar Binks is really shit

om nom nom nom
Jar Jar Binks is really shit
om nom nom nom
Jar Jar Binks is really shit

We're better than Lucas
when we redo this all the noobs will have bazookas
and in our version, Luke loses
now we're gonna talk you through this
this is Episode Seven: Attack of Gishnchips and Jewdacris

So we're pimpin' in our space crib, all chillin'
but we hear Jabba the Hut is having my sluts
so we break into his pad
shoot him in the kneecaps, or where his kneecaps would be if he wasn't a slug

So we're all blazin' up on the Death Star
feeling really really really genuinely way gangstar
bump into our homeboy Darth Vadar
he's like get you ass in the TIE Fightar

and Gish is like but I ain't got the neons done yet
and Vader's like d'you want me to go get Boba Fett
and Gish is like is that a type of cheese
and Vader's like no it's a bounty hunter

So we killed Darth Vader for giving us lip
took over the Death Star and we made it our crib
and we're like well this could have gone wacker
let's go kill Chewbacca 'cause he's a hairy cracker

So we di', actually, no we di'n't
we stole a DeLorian and killed Darth Vader at the beginnin'
so Star Wars became a romantic comedy
with much <???> Harrison lollity

And Darth Vader didn't exist, and the emperor was friendly
and we're all rolling around in a fucked-up Bentley
and Han Solo's all like yo yo yo yo
and everyone laughs 'cause he's a really wack rapper, but we're not

But we're not, we're the best in the universe
we knew it first and we only spits the <???> verse
so we drive by Jabba the Hut and all the ewoks
and you can buy our action figures up in dem shops

and Jar Jar Binks is really shit

and Jar Jar Binks is really shit

In a galaxy far, far away
Sanity Valve are still really really good

Yeah
In space, no-one can hear you being good at rapping
unless you're Sanity Valve

Episode I? More like Episode Not Very Good

Luke, I am your rapper

I don't like you any more, George Lucas
