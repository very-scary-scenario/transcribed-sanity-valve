C:: Windows 95
Sega Mega Drive
Nintendo 64
When Shearer used to score

M:: Back when Ant and Dec had successful rap careers
when Mr. Motivator came on I would clap and cheer
when that was near I wasn't all about gash and beer
I just gamed and Simply Red Holding Back the Years

I had no fears, except the head from Art Attack; he gave me heart attacks
apart from that, the girl from Brum gave me diarrhoea
back when England fucked up '96, I was twice as great
scoring fifty-odd goals on FIFA '98

Sega Mega Drive was gay and I'll bite your face
still waiting for my Spectrum to recognise its tapes
I take it out the player, check it twice, replace
to wait ninety days for an 8-bit fighting game

I rock a ProYo at school, demonstrate lots of cool
manoeuvres, come back, and watch Animal Hospital
the pimp of the school disco, why the fuck not
I would talk to girls and raid the fuck out of the tuck shop

C:: Windows 95
M::   Curtains on my head suited me nicely
A::     Bring back the bucket hat
C:: Sega Megadrive
M::   Take me back to Gladiators on a Saturday night please
A::     Bring back the bucket hat
C:: Nintendo 64
M::   A little dose of Vengaboys and some Five Alive please
A::     Bring back the bucket hat
C:: When Shearer used to score
M::   Taking up permanent residence in the nineties
A::     Bring back the bucket hat

G:: Catching Pokémon and [??], stealing the Pogs
back when you got action figures in a cereal box
Shaggy and Babylon Zoo on Top of the Pops
Zoë Ball and Jamie Theakston fucking rocking my socks

The reruns of Friends were just runs back then
watching 5 in my room, see what's on past ten
me and my friends, we were all Banana Men
except the one with no legs, he was SuperTed

Power Ranger blue or red, well I was always Black
Crash Bandicoot to distract from the chore in hand
that's when I thought Radiohead were a boring band
my Tamagotchi's way better, yours is gash

Cheats on Tomb Raider see Lara's pubic triangle
up, down, square, x, circle, x, triangle
back then, back when I couldn't even wank yet
I was eight years old and still slept with a blanket

M:: Curtains on my head suited me nicely…

M:: I hadn't even heard of smoke or booze or coke abuse
the furthest I would go is Hooch or maybe downing loads of Opal Fruits
finding idols was not that hard, I'd attack art in my Fun House
like Neil Buchanan and Pat Sharp

That part [a] back then shit meant the Fresh Prince was not to be messed with
murking Carlton in that dance
I was listening to Travis, Pulp, and Saturday Night
Maverick was the closest thing I came to tackling a rap bar

That far back our were lives weren't bad by looking at Hulk Hogan
wonder why I wasn't that hard
in my back garden with tankards of Sunny D
I was Mr. T, baddies didn't worry me

back then I didn't get with Gishnchips
I was more about Biff and Chip than spitting spits and killing Crips
reminisce a little bit about being little kids
funny how far twenty years does bring you, isn't it?

M:: Curtains on my head suited me nicely…

C:: Concordes in the sky
Steve Irwin was alive
when Blair still had respect
Twin Towers were erect
