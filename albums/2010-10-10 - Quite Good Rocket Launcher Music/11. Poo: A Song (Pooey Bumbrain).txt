Sometimes people sneeze and it's too cute
I look up sneezing puppies on YouTube
if you happen to run out of things to amuse you
listen to this tune about my war-torn poo chute

Poo-poo: inherently funny since the age of four
not when it looks like the aftermath of the Falklands War
my bowel's fallen foul to a beast infection
leaving my rectum lookin' a bit like Simon Weston, the Falklands burns guy

In my scrotum nearby, you fear why
you hear a herd of my sperm cry
The stenches that worsen with each of my stomach clenches
and even park benches start to smell the World War trenches

I can't explain the pain of each burning fart
except it really, really, really, really hurts my arse
My poo rips me open like I rip mikes
I chew my food, then, ironically, my shit bites

I sit tight, feels like I'm giving birth
women won't understand, but trust me, it flippin' hurts
Can't figure what's worse, if it emerged in ripping bursts
or if it lasts longer, coming in dribbly squirts

This particularly burns, start shitting blood
This particularly burns, I ain't shitting, blood
I get worried by curry and I fear the beer
Never you fear, diarrhea is here

My poo comes out, [was?] a burning hate, a poo
Looks like Arnie at the end of Terminator 2
My tissue looks like a work by Jackson Pollock
this poo was so hot it waxed my bollocks

Song about poo, song about poo
song about, song about, song about poo
Song about poo, song about poo
song about, song about, song about poo

Some poo, song about poo
song about, song about, song about poo
Song about poo, song about poo
song about, song about, song about-

Gishnchips had a shit with a bitter twist
this time it didn't just come with a bit of piss
Mos Prob has bad poos, but the difference is
your gastric system stayed in your body, didn't it?

So foul, Guantanamo Bay rejected it
A sad-looking fucker, like Fritzl neglected it
but even he'd be too scared to molest this
big enough for a load of bees to build a nest in

Zesty, lengthy, it virtually smiled
as it looked up at me from a pile of piles
a horror poo, the size of a small child
but too vile to appeal to any paedophile

I'm sad, like a rapper with no raps
can't believe I've fallen victim to a prolapse
if I had an audience, I would get a slow clap
wasn't expecting my intestines to go flat

Intensive care is my home now, bowels tried to blow out
It was like Eyjafjallaj√∂kull, no doubt
That's a volcano, which is pain for your bum
The rest of my body parts? They're all safe for your mum

It's the nuclear apoocalypse, but mine was worse
'cause yours was a waste expulsion, mine was birth
was so fuckin' big it even hides my girth
I just did a poo the size of Earth

Even if it was a messiah, it would go to hell
and would start the ice age if you froze the smell
if you're having bowel problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got ninety-nine organs and I shat out one
