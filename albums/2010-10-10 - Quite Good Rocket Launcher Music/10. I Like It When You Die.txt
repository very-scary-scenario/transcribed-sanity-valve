My bare hands, I rip their glands from their throats
Make them wish you never wrote wack bars and never spoke
Toothpick prod your epiglottis to make you sick
Abusive shit spat straight over classical music

Pencil? Nah, fuck it, we'll stick with sword
May be mighty, but fighting with an HB, bitches gored
Pen is mightier, the only fountain spouting from his mouth
is the clarity of my counterparts who couldn't count on their foul spits

Guns, Glocks, shotguns and Uzis
I endorse gun crime, and I'll kill you, so sue me
Seal clubber undercover, kill you with your own mother
Used to bludgeon after I fuck her literally with no rubber

I'm a classical god of war, yeah, you know it: Mars
Fuck throwing stars, I'll open your face and blow in SARS
Anthrax. I soak up blood like Tampax
Leave you covered in piss, like an elderly man's slacks

You preposterous wanker, I'll leave you pissing in bags, sir
I'll smoke and tan myself next to you to give you cancer
My last victim was found with a rounders bat in him
Kill you with a whole tree, just like The Happening

I strike with a hundred percent surgical accuracy
Leave you as the middle piece in my human centipede hacked at the knee
Biological warfare; got the flu, I'll breathe on you
Ram your toilet so far up your arse you no longer need to poo

Alert the cardiac unit, there's been a heart attack
From the MC who shat himself and died before I hardly spat
I'll bring the beef and infect it with BSE
Don't worry, I'll be humane when I euthanise you eventually

Strangle you to death with microphone cable
Laugh as your heart fails while I'm banging your wife on the table
You shouldn't bring knives to gunfights, you know that's just true
but you brought your .44 to face a rocket launcher, fuck you

We're definitely violent and we'll hurt you badly
We disagree with all hippies and Gandhi
Punching people is great fun; it makes us feel good
I'll kill your fucking face in and stab off your legs

When something disgruntles you, I get excited
I've lot count of all the bare peeps I fighted
We like it when you die and when you die, we like it
and when you don't die, we don't really like it

So go home, scallywag, you're served for luncheon
I'm sending you to Dignitas with my punching
So go home, scallywag, you're served for luncheon
I'm sending you to Dignitas with my punching
So go home, scallywag, you're served for luncheon
I'm sending you to Dignitas with my punching
